DESCRIPTION
lqvm-snap facilitates the creation, deletion and revertion of internal and
external snapshots.

-c, --create 'snapshot-name'  Create the named snapshot, -i or -e is mandatory.

-d, --delete 'snapshot-name'  Delete the named snapshot. This option merges the
snapshot data with the backing store and deletes the snapshot.
