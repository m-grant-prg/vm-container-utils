NAME
lqvm.conf - Configuration file for the lqvm suite.
DESCRIPTION
lqvm.conf contains one line for each parameter (Key / Value pair).
FILES
lqvm.conf	The parameters are as follows:-

connecturi=  A default connection to use, eg qemu:///system

diskname=  The name of the disk for the VM must be provided, it is used in
delete and revert of external snapshots. Usually the value can be found by using
the following command:-
.br
virsh -c qemu:///system dumpxml VM-NAME | grep 'target dev'
.br
You are looking for a bus of 'virtio'

bridge=  If a network bridge is available enter it here, otherwise leave the
line blank after the '='.

ethernetprefix=  The 3 letter prefix for ethernet interfaces, usually enp or
eth. This is used to determine if an interface is UP.

maxconcvms=  lqvms-sequential-start.sh can start multiple VMs in parallel, this
parameter limits the number of VMs to run in parallel.

seqstartvms=  A space separated list of VM names to start when using lqvms-sequential-start.sh.

The last line of this file must be terminated with a NewLine.

The file is stored in an etc directory. The exact location depends on the method
of installation but for Autotools installations on Linux this is likely to
be /usr/local/etc/lqvm.conf.
