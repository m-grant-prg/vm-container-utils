# This file should contain only basic tools. It should not contain:-
#	Packages that would need to be in the Build-Depends.
#		eg Doxygen required for a C package should not be here, it
#		should be in the lxcu install.list of the package itself.
#	Your own packages, to avoid circular dependencies (chicken and egg).
# It should contain things like clang, git etc, if required.
